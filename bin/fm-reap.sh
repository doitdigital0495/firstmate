#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-reap.sh - close finished workers so no crewmate or scout outlives its task.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-reap.sh list    every recorded crewmate and scout with its reap verdict
#   fm-reap.sh check   the watcher check (state/reaper.check.sh): one line when
#                      the set of due workers or the last run's outcome changes
#   fm-reap.sh run     tear down every due worker now, printing closed/kept
#   fm-reap.sh arm     write state/reaper.check.sh and bind it with
#                      bin/fm-check-register.sh (bootstrap arms it every start
#                      while config/reaper exists)
#   fm-reap.sh sweep-state [--apply] [--verbose]
#                      remove provably stale runtime leftovers from this home's
#                      top-level state folder. Without --apply it is a read-only
#                      dry run that prints the same counts by kind; --verbose
#                      also prints one line per entry. It never runs on its own.
#
# Due: a ship or scout task recorded in state/<id>.meta whose newest lifecycle
#   status (working, needs-decision, blocked, paused, done, failed) is done,
#   FM_REAP_DONE_SECS (default 7200) after that done line, or, while a Lavish
#   board is registered for the task (a state/procevent/*.source naming it as
#   owner_task), FM_REAP_BOARD_SECS (default 86400) after the later of that
#   line and the board's newest captured round. The done line's [at=<epoch>]
#   stamp is the clock; a line without one uses the status file's mtime.
#   Second mates are persistent homes and are never due; failed, blocked, and
#   waiting tasks are left for firstmate.
#   A lane that never wrote done is also due once it has finished its work and
#   is only holding capacity: its newest lifecycle line is working or paused,
#   its milestones show a passed gate-end with no gate-start or gate-obsolete
#   after it and a pr-created (PR ready) or merge, and its status file has been
#   quiet for FM_REAP_IDLE_SECS (default 7200; the board grace above applies
#   while a Lavish board is registered). Its verdict reads
#   `due gate passed, PR ready|merged, idle <n>h`. A malformed or unreadable
#   milestone record means not due. Teardown stays the only judge of landed
#   work, so due here never discards anything: an unlanded lane is kept.
#
# Mode: config/reaper holds `shadow` or `enforce`; without the file the reaper
#   is off and its check prints nothing. Roll out with a shadow week first.
#   shadow reports the due workers in one check line and closes nothing.
#   enforce starts `run` in the background and reports its outcome on the next
#   check. `run` calls bin/fm-teardown.sh <id> without --force, so a worker
#   whose work has not landed is kept, never discarded (AGENTS.md hard rule 3),
#   and a task the captain still holds keeps its backlog call; each kept
#   worker is named with teardown's own reason. FM_REAP_TEARDOWN replaces the
#   teardown command for tests only.
#
# Enforce report backoff: a kept worker stays due for as long as its work has
#   not landed, so `run` rewrites the same `kept` line on every check pass; the
#   report prints an unchanged kept line once, then again only after an
#   exponentially growing delay - FM_REAP_REPEAT_BASE_SECS (default 3600)
#   doubling per repeat, capped at FM_REAP_REPEAT_CAP_SECS (default 86400, the
#   daily reminder) - and at once when the line changes (a new teardown
#   reason, or the same worker closed: `closed` lines always print). The run
#   still happens on every check; only the report backs off. The ledger is
#   state/.reaper-repeat, one "<cksum> <last-print-epoch> <repeats> <line>" row per
#   known kept line, pruned to the lines the latest run log still names; any
#   ledger problem fails open (the line prints).
#
# sweep-state considers only the three families below; anything else in state/,
#   including task records, wake queues, .seen-* dedup records, inboxes and
#   handled records, teardown and landing protection records, and lock links, is
#   never a candidate. Any doubt keeps the entry.
#   lock-owner-*: a state/*.lock[.steal].owner.* directory minted by
#     bin/fm-wake-lib.sh that no state/ symlink names, older than
#     FM_REAP_LOCK_AGE_SECS (default 86400), holding only that lock's known
#     record files plus stray links whose targets are gone. Its recorded pid
#     must be dead by fm_lock_holder_alive (lock-owner-dead-pid), or the record
#     must be gone (lock-owner-released): an acquirer writes it before publishing
#     and a release deletes it, so a directory without one has been released. A
#     released owner survives when a losing acquirer's `ln -s` followed the lock
#     link and left a stray link inside it, which fails the holder's rmdir.
#   window-marker: a watcher per-window marker (bin/fm-watch.sh window_key) older
#     than FM_REAP_MARKER_AGE_SECS (default 604800) whose window, terminal, or
#     thread no state/*.meta or *.meta-prior record names and no state/.wake-queue
#     row mentions. Teardown deletes a closed task's record and the watcher only
#     reads markers of recorded windows, so no process can read such a marker;
#     pane existence is not probed because an unrecorded pane has no reader. An
#     unreadable record or queue refuses the whole sweep before anything changes.
#   home-summary-temp: a state/.home-summary{.json,-error}.XXXXXX scratch file a
#     killed refresh left, older than FM_REAP_MARKER_AGE_SECS, far past the
#     refresh's own bounded deadline.
