# Merge a task's PR or MR after recording pr= and any available pr_head= through
# bin/fm-pr-check.sh, so teardown can verify landed work after squash merges.
# The full canonical URL is parsed by bin/fm-pr-lib.sh. A GitHub pull request is
# addressed through gh by the derived owner and repository on the derived host,
# exported as GH_HOST for the whole run, which is github.com or a GitHub
# Enterprise host this home names in config/github-hosts; a GitLab merge
# request is addressed through glab by the project URL rebuilt from the parsed
# host and path, so any instance works and no host is hardcoded; a Forgejo
# pull request is addressed through tea by the derived owner and repository
# plus a "tea login" resolved fresh from the parsed host on every run. A Gerrit
# change is refused outright: that adapter is read-only, and the refusal at the
# parse below owns why.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-pr-merge.sh <task-id> <pr-url> [--attended-override] [--allow-red <check>]
#     [--allow-missing <check>] [--allow-no-pipeline] [-- <forge merge flags>]
#   fm-pr-merge.sh -h | --help
#
# Merge method on GitHub defaults to --squash when the caller passes none of
# --squash, --merge, --rebase, or --method after the optional -- separator.
# On Forgejo the merge style defaults to the repository's own
# default_merge_style, read live, and a merge is refused when it cannot be read.
# A GitHub merge is refused unless every pre-merge condition holds, each read
# live at merge time rather than taken from recorded metadata: the pull request
# is open, not a draft, mergeable, free of conflicts, every unwaived check
# is green at the exact current head commit, where github_checks_not_green below
# owns what makes a check green and judges each one by its current run, and
# every unwaived check the forge requires for the base branch has reported at
# that head. When mergeable is the only failing condition and reads UNKNOWN,
# meaning GitHub has not finished recomputing it, the caller re-reads and
# re-checks every condition after a short bounded wait instead of refusing;
# once that bound is spent it reports mergeability still pending rather than
# unmergeable, with the same nonzero exit as any other refusal.
# A required check that never reported is absent from the checks
# list rather than red, so github_read_required_contexts below reads the
# required set from classic branch protection and active rulesets. Check-run
# requirements retain their producer app binding: a same-named check run from another app cannot
# satisfy them, and a duplicate name-only entry cannot weaken that binding.
# Unbound requirements match by name. A bound requirement reported as a check
# run also needs a matching producer in the check-runs read at the verified
# head, while one reported as a commit status matches by name, because the
# status carries no app id to compare. Status-creator app binding is not verified
# here, so an attended --attended-override -- --admin merge can bypass that
# protection without a missing-check waiver when a same-named status reported.
# An unreadable producer read still refuses.
# Successfully read requirements remain checked even if another
# source fails, so known missing checks and all read errors are reported together.
# github_branch_rules_unavailable_on_plan owns the narrow plan-unavailable
# exception; every other unreadable required source refuses.
# Every failing condition is reported, not just the first.
# The verified head is then passed to gh as
# --match-head-commit, so a push that lands between that read and the merge
# fails the merge instead of landing commits nothing verified. Reading that
# state needs gh and jq, and either one absent stops the merge before any
# state is recorded. An attended --allow-red <check-name> may be passed once,
# with the name as a separate argument; it waives only checks with that exact
# name, still requires every other check green, and still binds the head. Its
# twin, an attended --allow-missing <check-name>, follows the same rules for one
# required check that has not reported: it waives only that exact name, still
# requires every other required check to have reported and every check to be
# green unless separately waived by --allow-red. It matches the required
# context name even for an app-bound requirement, and never waives an unreadable
# required source or producer read. Both are
# refused while the away-posture record exists, and neither
# applies on GitLab, where a merge already requires the head pipeline to have
# succeeded, or on Forgejo, where a merge already requires the head's combined
# commit status to have succeeded. After gh returns success, GitHub's live
# state is read back and
# accepted only when the pull request is merged or in the merge queue. gh's
# GraphQL API supplies that queue-aware read; when that read fails, gh-axi's
# own view still proves a landed merge, and every outcome it cannot prove
# refuses, reporting the failed gh read and naming both failed reads when the
# gh-axi view could not prove the outcome either.
# A base branch with an effective merge_queue rule merges through the queue when
# the caller passed nothing beyond an optional merge method (the queue's own
# method applies; the flag is only noted), in attended and away posture alike:
# the task's no-mistakes CI monitor on that branch is ended with axi handoff so
# nothing rebases or pushes to a queued pull request (a run that cannot be ended
# refuses the enqueue), the pull request is enqueued through GraphQL
# enqueuePullRequest bound to the verified head with expectedHeadOid, the
# accepted authority is persisted, and both locks are released before this script
# waits synchronously until GitHub reports it merged. That wait is what the away
# rule asks of a queued merge; a fire-and-forget enqueue is never done. A pull
# request that left the queue without merging (removed, failed required check,
# closed), a wait longer than FM_PR_MERGE_QUEUE_TIMEOUT seconds (default 7200),
# and a queue state unreadable five polls in a row (gh-axi may still prove a
# landing) are refusals, never landings; a removal quotes GitHub's recorded
# reason, and the poll stays armed. FM_PR_MERGE_QUEUE_POLL_INTERVAL
# (default 30) sets the poll gap. A run against an already queued pull request
# only waits. An explicit --auto, or any extra argument beyond a merge method,
# keeps the direct gh route below.
# If the pull request remains open after that direct route and the base branch
# has an effective merge_queue rule, an attended refusal names the queue's configured merge
# method and exact --attended-override -- --auto --<method> retry flags. While
# the away-posture record exists, the one asynchronous request that may run is
# exactly those retry flags with a single recognised queue method: --auto with
# any other method, with no method, on a base whose rules disagree or cannot be
# read, or with any argument beyond the method, is refused, and a base with no
# queue rule refuses --auto outright because no enqueue can carry it. Every
# pull request enqueued under away authority (this --auto route and the queue
# route alike) is recorded in the away queue list (bin/fm-afk-contract.sh),
# which the record's archive sweeps: an entry still in the merge queue when the
# away posture ends is dequeued, so a queued merge never lands on lapsed
# authority. An attended caller that already passed the configured method with
# --auto is told instead that the accepted request has not entered the queue and
# its queue state has to be re-checked.
# No method is selected for the caller in any case. A rules response that names
# no queue rule, one that could not be read, rules that disagree, and a method
# this script does not recognise are four distinct outcomes and are reported
# apart, because each one leaves the operator somewhere different.
# A caller-requested --auto that leaves the pull request neither merged nor
# queued is refused the same way and says auto-merge was armed with nothing
# landed or queued yet, or, when the merge command itself failed, that auto-merge
# was only requested; both are read from the caller's own arguments rather than
# from the forge's prose.
# Every refusal that follows a merge command which returned success quotes that
# command's own output, marked as the forge's text and kept apart from this
# script's verdict, including the refusal for an outcome that cannot be read;
# a merge command that failed keeps its original error surfaced raw and first.
# GitLab adds no method flag at all: its merge method is the project's own
# setting, which the merge API applies, and imposing squash there would override
# that convention rather than mirror the GitHub default.
#
# A GitLab merge is refused unless every pre-merge condition holds, each read
# live at merge time rather than taken from recorded metadata: the merge request
# is open, detailed_merge_status is mergeable, has_conflicts is false,
# blocking_discussions_resolved is true, and the head pipeline succeeded at the
# exact current head commit. Every failing condition is reported, not just the
# first. An attended --allow-no-pipeline, for a repository that deliberately
# runs no merge request pipeline, waives only the pipeline condition and only
# when GitLab reports head_pipeline as present and null: a failed, running,
# canceled, or stale pipeline still refuses, every other condition still
# holds, and a project that requires a pipeline to succeed still refuses
# through detailed_merge_status. It is refused while the away-posture record
# exists and on any forge other than GitLab. The verified head is then passed
# to glab as --sha, so a push that lands between that read and the merge fails
# the merge instead of landing commits nothing verified. A recorded pr_head that disagrees with the live head is
# reported rather than trusted, because a rebase moves the head and leaves the
# recorded value stale. Reading that state needs glab and jq, and either one
# absent stops the merge before any state is recorded.
#
# A Forgejo merge is refused unless every pre-merge condition holds, each read
# live at merge time: the pull request is open, not a draft, mergeable is
# true, and the combined commit status at the exact current head, read across
# every status page, is success (an unconfigured status, reported as "none",
# refuses rather than being treated as nothing to check, the same reading
# GitLab's null head_pipeline gets above). Every
# failing condition is reported, not just the first. tea exposes no head-
# binding flag on its own merge subcommand, so the verified head is instead
# passed as head_commit_id to a direct call against Forgejo/Gitea's REST API
# (through "tea api"), which rejects a mismatched value with "head out of
# date" - verified against a real instance, along with every claim below about
# tea's and the API's exact behavior. Also unlike gh and glab, that API call
# reports an HTTP-level failure with exit status 0, so the merge is never
# judged by its own exit status: only a follow-up read confirming merged=true
# counts as landed. tea addresses a repository by owner/repository slug only;
# the host comes from a named "tea login" rather than the URL the way gh and
# glab take one, so the login registered for the parsed host is re-resolved
# fresh at merge time (bin/fm-pr-check.sh already required one at arm time,
# but a login can be renamed or removed afterwards). Reading and merging both
# need tea and jq, and either one absent stops the merge before any state is
# recorded. Forgejo has no merge-queue or scheduled-merge concept, so unlike
# GitHub and GitLab there is no away-mode async/queued case to detect: every
# accepted Forgejo merge here is immediate, and any caller-passed extra
# argument beyond a merge method is refused rather than silently dropped,
# because there is no established translation from a gh/glab-style flag into
# a Forgejo API field yet.
#
# Before either forge merge, the task's existing per-task control lock
# serializes the captain-hold check through the forge command. A still-held or
# unreadable row refuses before that command, so a captain approval must be
# recorded as an `answer --release` before this entrypoint is invoked. While
# an away record exists (a quiet-mode record is a present captain, so its
# merges stay attended: bin/fm-afk-contract.sh mode) any green merge may
# proceed under away authority:
# the record's presence is the whole mechanical fact, and which merge the
# captain's away words meant is the supervision session's reading
# (bin/fm-branch-prompt.sh "Postures"). An unreadable record refuses rather
# than being skipped, neither posture releases a captain hold, and away
# authority lapses when the record is archived.
# The authority read and synchronous forge command share the away record's
# cross-subsystem lock, which bin/fm-afk-contract.sh owns, closing the common
# live-owner TOCTOU; failure to take it refuses before the forge call. While
# away, every asynchronous merge path is refused except the merge-queue
# enqueues the away-posture record's archive can dequeue: the queue route and
# the exact --auto --<method> enqueue (see the queue notes above). Two
# confused-agent-grade limitations are
# accepted rather than hidden: queue or base changes after GitHub's preflight can
# still enqueue, and killing this shell can orphan a forge child after stale-lock
# recovery. docs/architecture.md owns those away-merge limits, while
# docs/captain-hold-lifecycle.md owns the separate merge-to-cleanup residual.
# A failed forge command releases the lock after it returns. A successful one
# retains the lock until the accepted merge authority is persisted against the
# still-matching task metadata.
#
# Extra args must not include --repo or -R in any form, including a bundled
# short-option cluster such as -yR, because the repository comes only from the
# URL, nor --sha or --match-head-commit because the head comes only from the
# live read. An existing task-meta pr= must equal the requested canonical URL,
# unless that bound PR has already merged - proven by its recorded merge
# notification - in which case the task's next PR is accepted so several PRs
# from one task can each merge in turn; while the bound PR is still unmerged a
# different URL is refused. Auto-merge (--auto), a protection bypass
# (--admin), and branch
# deletion (--delete-branch, -d and short-flag clusters, and GitLab's
# --remove-source-branch) are refused by default; --attended-override, parsed
# before the optional -- separator, re-enables those forge flags for an
# explicit captain instruction and never skips the live green check, the
# away-record read, or a captain hold.
#

#
# On GitLab, this script confirms the MR is actually merged before reporting it;
# an auto-merge-queued or unconfirmed request leaves the poll armed and records
# no landed outcome. bin/fm-merge-outcome-lib.sh owns a confirmed merge's
# destination, normal-case deduplication, and at-least-once recovery.
# A landed merge whose outcome cannot be written is reported loudly rather than
# misreported as a failed merge.

# Every GitHub check that is not green in the given live pull-request JSON, one
# name per line. An entry is green when it is a status context whose state is
# SUCCESS, or a check run that completed with SUCCESS, NEUTRAL, or SKIPPED (so
# a pending check is not green either). Exits nonzero when the rollup cannot be
# read, so a malformed answer is a failed read and never an empty red set.
#
# The rollup can hold several runs of one check name at the same head, because
# GitHub cancels a pull request's in-flight run when the base branch advances
# and re-triggers it; the cancelled run stays in the rollup beside the passing
# re-run. A check is therefore judged by its current run rather than by any run
# that a later one superseded, which is what makes this agree with GitHub's own
# CLEAN mergeStateStatus instead of refusing a pull request GitHub considers
# mergeable.
#
# Supersession applies only among check runs with the same reported name. A
# name is dropped from the red set only when every non-green run is COMPLETED,
# has a whole-second UTC startedAt, and started strictly before a green run.
# Status contexts are never grouped or superseded, and every non-green one is
# reported independently. A still-running, queued, undated, or tied check run
# stays red. A name whose runs are all green needs no timestamp, while a name
# with no green run stays red.
#
# The reported name is also what --allow-red matches. An unnamed check run is
