# Behavior tests for bin/fm-forget.sh (remove, restore, list, feed) and the
# suggestion verbs it drives in bin/fm-suggestions.sh (list --json, drop,
# restore): a removed row comes back identical, a 20-task batch round-trips,
# every guard keeps its task with a reason and moves nothing, links cut at
# removal come back, a crash between cutting and moving repairs itself, and old
# removals are archived, never deleted. Assertions are on task state through
# the backlog wrapper and on command output, never on source text.
