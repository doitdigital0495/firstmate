# Firstmate-imposed hold expiry through the watcher's real queue interface.
# No endpoint, harness process, model call, or remote host is needed.
#
# A hold firstmate imposed on a task (fm-send --hold) is recorded in that
# task's status with an expiry. When it lapses, the watcher must raise ONE
# actionable wake naming the hold and the exact renew/release commands - and
# nothing else may wake. These tests drive the real tick with deterministic
# clock epochs:
#   1. A hold not yet due is silent, and one already waked never repeats.
#   2. A lapsed hold queues exactly one wake carrying the renew/release
#      commands; the durable marker, not the queue row, is what stops repeats.
#   3. Renewal supersedes: a new id wakes once at its own expiry.
#   4. Release ends everything silently and cleans the marker.
#   5. Crew-declared paused: waits and captain-held lines never wake here, an
#      unparseable until fails safe (lapsed, not far-future), and the scan
#      cadence bounds the fleet pass.
